The Q on the board hits villain's range well, making them likely to call with QQ, AQ, or even AA/KK. A half-pot bet of $25 is the optimal play as it builds the pot while allowing villain to continue with their strong holdings. Going all-in would be too aggressive and might fold out hands that would pay me off. This board is relatively dry with no flush or straight draws, so I can extract value across multiple streets rather than trying to get all the money in immediately."
