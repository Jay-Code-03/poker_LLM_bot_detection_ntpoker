This dry, low board heavily favors my range as the 4-bettor, connecting better with my strong pairs and high cards than villain's calling range. A half-pot bet ($25) is optimal here as it builds the pot while giving villain poor odds to draw with hands like 88-TT, AK, or AQ that missed. While I have backdoor flush and straight draws as additional equity, my overpair is already strong enough to value bet. The SPR is 1.5, meaning we're committed to stacks if villain plays back aggressively. A half-pot sizing balances pot building with protection while allowing room to navigate turn decisions."

The pot odds of 16.7% aren't favorable given our limited equity - we have no draws and only 3 outs to improve to a pair of Aces, which might still be behind. Our previous check was to preserve pot control, but now facing a bet with poor equity and being out of position for future streets, folding is the most profitable play. Continuing would commit too much of our stack with minimal ways to improve."

The 8h turn doesn't significantly change the board texture - it doesn't complete obvious draws and doesn't pair the board. My hand remains vulnerable against Villain's preflop raising range which contains many Ax hands. Checking allows me to: 1) Control the pot size with my medium-strength hand, 2) See if Villain continues to represent strength, 3) Potentially check-raise if Villain makes a small bet with a weak hand, and 4) Check-call with my second pair if the bet sizing is reasonable.

While I've improved, this is still a medium-strength hand that's vulnerable against Villain's preflop raising range. The completed flush draw on the river (7h) makes leading out risky as Villain likely has many flush combinations in their range. Checking maintains pot control and gives me flexibility to either call a reasonable bet with my two pair or fold to a large bet that likely represents a flush or better. This check is consistent with my previous streets' strategy of playing cautiously with a vulnerable made hand against the preflop aggressor."
