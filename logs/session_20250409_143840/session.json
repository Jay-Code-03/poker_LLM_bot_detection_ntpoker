Villain has now shoved all-in for $89.50 into a $110.50 pot, requiring me to call nearly my entire stack. This is a dramatic shift from their small turn bet of $4.20, suggesting they either: 1) slow-played a strong hand on the turn, 2) improved to a strong hand on the river, or 3) are bluffing with a busted draw. Given the completed straight possibilities (7-8-9-10-J and 8-9-10-J-Q), and the fact that villain's range contains many Jx hands that beat me, I'm facing too many value hands in villain's range. Even if villain is occasionally bluffing here, I would need them to be bluffing over 44% of the time to make this call profitable, which is extremely unlikely given the betting pattern. With just 7-high and no draws left, I have to fold and preserve my remaining stack."

The board heavily favors Villain's 4-betting range which contains many Ax hands. We're out of position with a weak holding against a range advantage. Our stack-to-pot ratio is only 1.5, giving us poor implied odds for our backdoor draws. Betting would be extremely risky as we'd likely face a shove from any Ax hand. Checking preserves our stack while allowing us to see a free turn card that might improve our backdoor draws. This also gives us the opportunity to potentially bluff on favorable turn cards that are less likely to have helped Villain's range."

Folding preserves our remaining stack for better spots rather than investing more into a hand where we're significantly behind Villain's betting range."
