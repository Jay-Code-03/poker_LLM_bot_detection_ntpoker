Our hand has very little showdown value against BB's calling range which likely contains many Ax hands, pocket pairs, and Broadway cards. While we do have backdoor flush and straight draws, these are low-percentage opportunities that don't justify a bet. The board hits BB's calling range well, particularly with Ax hands. Betting would only get calls from better hands and folds from worse hands, giving us no value. Checking preserves pot control, keeps the pot small with our weak holding, and allows us to see a free turn card that might improve our backdoor draws. If BB checks behind, we maintain pot control; if they bet, we can easily fold this weak holding."

This is a major change from the flop where we only had backdoor draws. With 8 outs to complete our straight, we have approximately 17% equity to hit on the river. A bet of $3.8 (76% pot) serves multiple purposes: 1) We can win immediately if villain folds hands like weak Ax or underpairs, 2) We build a pot for when we hit our straight, and 3) We deny free equity to villain's drawing hands. While we checked the flop with minimal equity, the turn has given us significant drawing equity that justifies an aggressive line. This bet size applies pressure while giving us the right price to continue drawing to our straight."

This is extremely concerning as villain's line represents a very strong hand, most likely a 9 for trips or a pocket pair that has villain ahead. In a 4-bet pot, villain's calling range is typically strong pairs (TT+) and premium hands like AK/AQ. The fact that villain is now raising big suggests they connected well with this board. With just A-high, I have minimal equity against villain's raising range here. Even though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds, I don't have the 25% equity needed against a range heavily weighted toward trips and overpairs. Continuing my previous street reasoning, while I was right to c-bet for value and protection, the dynamic has completely changed with villain's aggressive response."
